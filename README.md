# Independent Cascade Model implementation using NetworkX library

This project has two main goals: 
* Analysis and assessment based on closeness, clustering, coefficient, betweeness and degree (facebook graph).
* Examine information diffusion based on the Independent Cascade Model.

### General info:
* Language: Python
* Main library: NetworkX
